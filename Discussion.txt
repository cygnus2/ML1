1. After plotting a histogram of the prices alone, there seem to be
   some properties with super high costs, like > 10^7. 
   Can one obtain useful information from them, or are they like anomalies?

2. Maybe an idea is to use covariance of the prices with some of the features
   to check which feature is important. 

3. My octave implemenation complains out of memory! GAH!
