Debasish:

1. After plotting a histogram of the prices alone, there seem to be
   some properties with super high costs, like > 10^7. 
   Can one obtain useful information from them, or are they like anomalies?

2. Maybe an idea is to use covariance of the prices with some of the features
   to check which feature is important. 

3. My octave implemenation complains out of memory! GAH!

1. From the histogram of prices, maybe it is a good idea to do some sort of 
   transformation of the data. Given that the histogram shows a very long tail
   using the mean for feature renormalization might not be a good idea.

2. A naive look at the correlation between the variables 3,4,5 does not show 
   any particularly interesting result. Maybe because of 1. (??)

3. By plotting full_sq vs. life_sq it is clear that there is some 
   misstyped/wrong data. Logically, life_sq <= full_sq, but actually there are
   36 examples where this is not true. This is a 0.15%, so quite small, but 
   it could give problems in the analysis. How much of the data is wrong?
