Miguel: 
In order to clean up loading the data, I have created the file loadData.m
It reads train.csv and outputs a matrix with all the non-numeric entries 
transformed to nan. This should be easier to handle for the analysis.

-Also, it is faster if instead of reading train.csv everytime, the data is 
saved in train.mat. To produce train.mat for the first time, simply use 
>> loadData;

This will create train.mat, and then sberbank can be run faster.

Miguel:

I have created the file explore.m, in which we can study the features. I thought 
it would be better to separate this from the proper regression/learning to be 
done in sberbank.m

For now there is some overlap with sberbank.m but we should clean this up later on.

Simply run:

>> explore;

Miguel:

I have modified the file loadData.m, now it loads either train.csv or test.csv
